# SEO & Publishing Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing new categories, top lists, or product pages.

## Content & metadata
- [ ] Unique, descriptive title that includes the current year when relevant.
- [ ] Meta description summarizes the page in 1–2 sentences and includes the year when applicable.
- [ ] Canonical URL matches the public route.
- [ ] OG image set (use the hero or category image for the page).
- [ ] Structured data is present (Breadcrumbs, Article/Product/Collection when appropriate).
- [ ] No AI-generated copy is published without human review and edits.

## Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Headings follow a logical hierarchy (single H1).
- [ ] All meaningful images have descriptive alt text.
- [ ] Decorative icons are marked `aria-hidden="true"`.
- [ ] Forms include associated labels and helpful hint text.
- [ ] Links and buttons have clear labels (avoid “click here”).

## Internal linking
- [ ] Link to parent category or top-list directory.
- [ ] Link to related lists or products where relevant.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs are present and accurate.

## Quality & compliance
- [ ] Facts, specs, and pricing are verified or clearly sourced from public product data.
- [ ] Affiliate links use `rel="nofollow sponsored"`.
- [ ] Ensure no secrets are committed (use `.env.sample` and `.env.example`).
