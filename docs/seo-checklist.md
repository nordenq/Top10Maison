# SEO publishing checklist

- ✅ Unique title (< 60 characters) with primary keyword and current year
- ✅ Meta description (< 155 characters) that summarizes the page and encourages clicks
- ✅ Canonical URL set via `getPageMeta`
- ✅ OpenGraph & Twitter images set via `ogImage` (correct dimensions, under 1 MB)
- ✅ Structured data present (breadcrumbs; product, article, or collection schema as appropriate)
- ✅ Alt text for all meaningful images; mark decorative images with `aria-hidden="true"`
- ✅ Logical heading order (one H1, descending H2/H3)
- ✅ Internal links to related categories, top lists, and products; avoid orphan pages
- ✅ No thin, unreviewed AI content; human review required
- ✅ Page included in sitemap; noindex only when intentional
- ✅ Performance: target LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1; test with Lighthouse/PageSpeed
- ✅ Mobile menu and interactive elements expose clear focus states and accessible labels
