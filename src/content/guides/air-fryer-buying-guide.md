## What matters
- Capacity: 4–6 qt suits 2–4 people; go larger for sheet-pan style meals.
- Controls: analog dials are simple; presets plus temperature probes add precision.
- Basket vs. oven style: baskets circulate air quickly; oven styles fit more and toast better.
- Materials: look for dishwasher-safe baskets and removable trays for easier degreasing.

## Quick safety notes
Preheat briefly, avoid aerosol sprays that damage nonstick, and keep space around vents for airflow.
