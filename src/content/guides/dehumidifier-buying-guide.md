## What matters
- Capacity: match the pint rating to room size and moisture level; larger units cycle less often.
- Drainage: continuous hose drain prevents bucket emptying; pumps help when the drain is above the unit.
- Filters: reusable mesh filters keep coils clean; rinse monthly.
- Noise and efficiency: check decibel ratings and ENERGY STAR certification for lower operating costs.

## Placement tips
Keep doors/windows closed in the target area, leave clearance around the intake and exhaust, and route hoses with a smooth downward run to avoid clogs.
