## What matters
- Navigation: lidar maps faster and handles edges; bump-and-go is cheaper but slower.
- Suction and brush design affect hair pickup; look for detachable rollers for easy cleaning.
- Battery life and auto-dock behavior set how well it covers larger floors.
- App features: room naming, no-go lines, and multi-floor maps help avoid trouble spots.

## Maintenance checklist
Empty the bin after each run, wash filters monthly if washable, and trim hair from rollers weekly to keep suction steady.
