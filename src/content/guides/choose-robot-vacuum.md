## Map your space
Note floor types, thresholds, and the number of rooms. Basic bump-navigation models suit open plans; tighter layouts benefit from mapping so the robot covers every zone.

## Battery and bin basics
Look for enough runtime to finish a full level without frequent recharging. A larger dust bin reduces emptying; a self-empty dock is useful only if you want longer stretches between maintenance.

## Brushes and suction fit
Combination roller + side brush setups handle mixed flooring well. If you have lots of carpet, prioritize steady suction over peak specs; for hard floors, debris edge pickup matters more.

## App controls and routines
Scheduling by room, simple no-go lines, and a manual spot-clean option are the controls most people use. Advanced features are optional if you mainly run daily sweeping.
