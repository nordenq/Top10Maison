## Size to your room
Measure the square footage of the room you’ll use most. Choose a unit whose clean air delivery rate matches that area instead of relying on vague “large room” labels.

## Pick the right filters
Confirm it uses a true HEPA stage for fine particles and an activated carbon stage if you need odor or smoke control. Note the expected replacement interval so upkeep stays predictable.

## Plan for placement and noise
Airflow needs clearance on every side. Compare noise levels at low and medium settings; those are the speeds you’ll likely run day-to-day.

## Check energy and controls
An Energy Star label keeps long-run power draw modest. Simple controls, a basic auto mode, and a filter-change indicator are enough—extras aren’t required for good performance.
