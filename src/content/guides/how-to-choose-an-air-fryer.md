An air fryer uses hot air circulation to cook food with little to no oil.
Before choosing one, focus on a few practical factors that affect everyday use.

## Capacity
For 1–2 people, a 3–4 qt air fryer is usually sufficient.
Families benefit from 5–6 qt models or dual-basket designs for flexibility.

## Basket type

## Temperature range
Models that reach higher maximum temperatures offer more versatility, especially for crisping and roasting.
