## What matters
- Match the CADR and square-foot rating to your room size.
- Prefer true HEPA filters; add activated carbon when odors or smoke are concerns.
- Check noise levels (dB) at sleep and max settings.
- Look for filter change indicators and readily available replacements.

## Quick setup tips
Place units away from walls and corners, run on high for the first hour, then balance noise and airflow. Replace filters on the manufacturer cadence or sooner if air quality drops.
